# Hey, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer and devops engineer from Brighton. You'll usually find me writing code, hacking away at a backend or microservice, or tinkering with a Linux server.
I like to explore new technologies and make interesting things with them.

I currently work as a Software Developer at [Radical](https://www.radicalcompany.com).

I've built a number of [projects](./projects.html) in my spare time, and I'm always looking for new open source projects to contribute to.
