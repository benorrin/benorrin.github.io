# Hey, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer and devops engineer from sunny Brighton. You'll usually find me writing code, hacking away at a backend or microservice, or tinkering with a Linux server.
I like to explore new technologies and make interesting things with them.

I currently work as a Software Developer for the lovely folks at [Radical](https://www.radicalcompany.com). You can take a look at some of the [clients I've worked with]({{ site.url }}/portfolio) and challenges I've tackled during my time there.

I've also built a few [projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) in my spare time.
