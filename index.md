**Hi, I'm Ben** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer and devops engineer from London. You'll usually find me writing code, hacking away at a backend or microservice, or tinkering with a Linux server.
I like to explore new technologies and make interesting things with them.

I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Radical](https://www.radicalcompany.com).

I recently graduated with a BSc Hons in **Computer Science** from [The Open University](https://open.ac.uk) and I'm currently looking to start my journey in the industry.

I've built a number of [projects](./projects.html) in my spare time, and I'm always looking for new open source projects to contribute to.
