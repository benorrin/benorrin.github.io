Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ben, a software developer currently living in Brighton. Originally from Chelmsford, I made the move to Brighton back in the summer of 2023 and haven't looked back since.

I've been honing my skills as a [software developer at Radical](https://www.radicalcompany.com/) since 2022.

Curious about what I've been working on? [Check out my portfolio](/portfolio), where I showcase select client projects from my time at Radical. Each one comes with a short case study to give you a taste of the challenges I've tackled.
