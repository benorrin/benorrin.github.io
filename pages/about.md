Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ben, a software developer currently living in Brighton. Originally from Chelmsford, I made the move to Brighton back in the summer of 2023 and haven't looked back since â€“ the sea air and vibrant community here have won me over!

I've been honing my skills as a [software developer at Radical](https://www.radicalcompany.com/) since 2022. With a BSc Hons in Computer Science under my belt, I dive into projects with passion and precision.

Curious about what I've been working on? [Check out my portfolio](/portfolio), where I showcase select client projects from my time at Radical. Each one comes with a short case study to give you a taste of the challenges I've tackled.

On my [projects page](/projects), you'll find a peek into my personal hobbyist projects. From coding experiments to DIY adventures, it's where I let my creativity roam free.

And if you're up for a good read, [swing by my blog](/blog). Sure, there's tech and work stuff in there, but I also spill the beans on my hobbies, interests, and whatever else catches my fancy. It's my corner of the internet where I share whatever's on my mind.

Speaking of the internet, I'm all about bringing back that old-school vibe. Say goodbye to social media â€“ my website is my digital home, where I'm trialling a return to the days when everyone had their own little corner of the web.

Want to chat? Drop me a line at [ben@orrin.uk](mailto:ben@orrin.uk). And for added security, I've got a [GPG key](/gpg) ready to go â€“ safety first, right?
