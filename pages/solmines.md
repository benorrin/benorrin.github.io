SolMines is an example webapp created to showcase modern, scalable web development. Users can register an account and win prentend money placing bets in a fun twist on the classic PC game minesweeper.

The app is fully scalable, utilising AWS for itâ€™s backend infrastructure. The project uses industry standards such as Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, version control and unit testing to aid development.

        <strong>Note:</strong> 
        Due to cost constraints with AWS, the live demo backend is currently offline. If you would like to test the app for yourself, send me an email and I would be more than happy to spin up an instance for you upon request.
