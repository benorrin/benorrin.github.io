# Colophon

## Hosting
This website is proudly hosted on an old ASUS PC tucked away in the comfort of my bedroom here in Brighton. Despite its age, this trusty machine faithfully serves as the backbone of my online presence.

## Site Generation
The pages of this website come to life through the magic of static HTML generation with Jekyll. I've toyed around with plenty of blogging platforms, CMS' and static site generators over the years - but I find that the simplest solution is the best one.

I'm considering toying around with creating my files within emacs org mode, but thats a discussion for another day...

## Content Creation
Crafting the content for this website is a labor of love, made possible by the powerful simplicity of Markdown. Armed with GNU Emacs, I immerse myself in the creative flow, sculpting each word and expression to convey my thoughts and ideas with clarity and precision.
